/* NOTE: Other commonly used sections
 *      - Panics: The scenarios in which the function being
 *                documented could panic. Callers of the function
 *                who donâ€™t want their programs to panic should
 *                make sure they donâ€™t call the function in these
 *                situations.
 *      - Errors: If the function returns a Result, describing the
 *                kinds of errors that might occur and what
 *                conditions might cause those errors to be
 *                returned can be helpful to callers so they can
 *                write code to handle the different kinds of
 *                errors in different ways.
 *      - Safety: If the function is unsafe to call (we discuss
 *                unsafety in Chapter 19), there should be a
 *                section explaining why the function is unsafe and
 *                covering the invariants that the function expects
 *                callers to uphold.
