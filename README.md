# rust-tutorial
My adventures learning Rust from "The Rust Programming Language" from rust-lang.org.

This will be my public repo containing Rust code as I follow along the chapters from "The Rust Programming Language". My code will be separated by chapter from the book.

I'll be using the using the most recent Rust compiler available from APT in Debian Bookworm. Rust was installed by running the following command:

>`$ sudo apt install rust-all`

I've used this alternate method because I prefer to use the package manager. If necessary, I'll switch to using `rustup` as recommended by the book's authors.

## Update: 19 Apr 2023

I have finished going through the book, appendices and all! It was an interesting ride, and I look forward to using Rust for future projects.
